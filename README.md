# ðŸš€ Russian Male Last Name Generator

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and code for a research project aimed at training and evaluating a neural network to generate Russian male last names. The project uses character-based language models to replicate Russian surname generation.

## Contents
- **Training_the_model_2_evaluations.ipynb**: This notebook includes the training of the model and evaluating it using suffix analysis and Google search validations.
- **GPT_eval_API.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the model's evaluation using the OpenAI GPT API, assessing the authenticity of the generated last names.
- **predicted_last_names.csv**: Contains a list of last names generated by the model.

## Methodology
The project uses three primary strategies for model evaluation:
- **OpenAI GPT Evaluation**: Uses ChatGPT to verify the authenticity and linguistic accuracy of the generated names.
- **Suffix Analysis**: Focuses on the frequency of common suffixes found in Russian surnames within the generated names.
- **Google Search Validation**: Checks the existence and frequency of the generated names in real-world scenarios through Google search results.
