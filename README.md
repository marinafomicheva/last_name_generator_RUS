Research and Evaluation
The project evaluates the generated names using three distinct approaches:

Model Authenticity Check with OpenAI's ChatGPT: Leveraging the capability of ChatGPT to assess the authenticity of generated last names.
Linguistic Pattern Recognition: Focusing on suffix patterns characteristic of Russian last names.
Real-World Relevance through Google Search: Checking the occurrence of generated names in real-world data.
